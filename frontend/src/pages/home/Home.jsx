          Participants must workout a minimum of 30 minutes per day, 5 days a week. The 5th workout may be walking (Do not abuse this rule or we will remove it).

Proof of your workout must be posted by the end of the day in the workout group chat on WhatsApp. Valid proof of the workout must include the following: a selfie of yourself, the number of workout for that week you are doing, your name, and a short description of the workout you did. Examples of acceptable workouts include any of the following:  competitive sports, hiking, biking, running, yoga, workout class, dance class, workout video or gym. Examples of workouts that will NOT be allowed/counted include: running through the airport, pushing your stroller, yard work, shoveling snow, ping pong, bowling, dancing at a club or wedding, cleaning your house, or driving range. Please use good judgement and integrity! Walking will only be allowed ONCE a week, unless you have a VALID excuse, such as being sick, injured or pregnant, approved by and sent privately to the organizers, Melody Lebaron or Vanessa LeBaron or Stefany Patrick.

          Be mindful of the outfit you choose, as it is NOW REQUIRED to use the same outfit for your BEFORE & AFTER pictures.  We suggest 2-piece bathing suit or shorts and a sports bra, whichever you are most comfortable with. We also suggest that you take your pictures in front of a white background. Vanessa Lebaron is the only one that will look at and save your pictures/weight. She will not share with anyone else, but hold on to them, until the challenge ends. She will then forward them back to their owner so that you can put them together with your after pictures, and if you choose, share with the group. Ladies, we will NOT accept after pictures that have a different outfit or that is paired with a flexed and relaxed picture side by side. Valid after pictures must have your face hidden, same outfit, and a before relaxed with an after relaxed or a before flexed with an after flexed.
