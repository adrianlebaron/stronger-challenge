            This challenge is about integrity, commitment and brotherhood.
            Everyone who signs up is making a commitment to themselves, their
            families and their friends. If you cheat, you are only cheating
            yourself, no one else.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are here to support each other, to better ourselves, to put our
            bodies to the test, to push our limits, to create better habits and
            to live better lives by being active and taking back whatâ€™s ours. We
            are the masters of our fates and the captains of our souls.

              Work will not count as a workout. Active sports will count as a
              workout such as: basketball, volleyball, baseball, etc. Hiking
              will count. Fishing will not count. You are allowed 1 round of
              golf per week to count as a workout. Running through the airport
              will not count. Use good judgement, donâ€™t make us have to tell you
              what a workout is.
